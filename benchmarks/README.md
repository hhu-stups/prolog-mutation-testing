### ACOL VM

Usually, bytecode interpreters are far more efficient than AST interpreters.
In order to evaluate the performance different interpreter designs (AST, Bytecode, ...) in Prolog,
we designed a small imperative language named ACOL.
It only contains basic integer arithmetic, variable assignments, if-statements and while-loops.
Surprisingly, in Prolog, AST interpreters usually are more efficient than bytecode interpreters.

#### parser.pl

A basic parser for ACOL using DCGS.

#### ast_interpreter.pl

A basic AST interpreter for ACOL as it is idiomatic to write.

#### rational_trees.pl

A twist on the AST interpreter:
for while-loops, rational trees are used in order to (infinitely) expand all iterations of the loop.

#### compiler.pl

This module compiles the AST into a list of bytecodes.
The bytecode itself is designed for ACOL and not an existing one.

#### assert_bc.pl

A bytecode interpreter.
All instructions and arguments are asserted as facts for fast lookup instead of maintaining a list.
This allows to manage jumps in the code in a faily performant manner.

#### rt_bytecode.pl

A bytecode interpreter with a twist:
the bytecode is threaded in a manner where instead of jumps, again rational trees are used.
